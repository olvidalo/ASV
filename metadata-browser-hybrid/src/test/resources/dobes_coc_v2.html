		<h3>General Statements</h3>
		<p>The Code of Conduct determines ethical guidelines for all participants in the DOBES
			documentation program and the users of the resulting resources. Fieldworkers,
			archivists, users, and funding agencies have to accept this CoC as the basic guideline
			for their activities. Any violation of these guidelines will be taken seriously and may
			have the consequence of loss of permission to contribute to the program or to use the
			data.</p>
		<p>
			As indicated in the figure different parties are involved in DOBES program with
			different roles:</p>

		<p>The acting teams in DOBES (indicated by a light yellow color) are embedded in
			organizational structures all defining legal frameworks of a different nature. To define
			a common basis for all persons and organizations involved in DOBES a Code of
			Conduct was defined and all are bound to adhere to its rules. Also all users of the
			DOBES material will have to accept the Code of Conduct as their basis.</p>
		<p>A Linguistic Advisory Board will give advice to the archivist to carry out his task in
			accordance with the international efforts in documenting endangered languages. This
			Linguistic Advisory Board will be asked for advice in matters where conflicts about
			ethical behavior occur. To achieve this, internationally respected members of the
			linguistic field researcher community will be members of this board.</p>
		<h3>Ethical Rules</h3>
		<li>Everyone will respect the Intellectual and Cultural Property Rights of the
			individual consultants and their communities. Wishes with respect to
			protecting the privacy of individuals will be respected.</li>
		<li>No one is allowed to offend the religious feelings of the consultants or
			communities. No missionary or political activities are allowed to be carried
			out under the umbrella of the DOBES documentation task.</li>
			<li>No one is allowed to use the recorded and analyzed data for commercial
			purposes without permission from the speech community.
			a. It is the speech community that deals with the issue of commercial uses.
			The speech community not only gives permission, but also decides all
			aspects involved in the commercial use (copyrights, sharing profits, etc).
			b. If the speech community does allow a user to make commercial uses, then
			the user should present a contract agreed with the speech community. This
			contract should be officially recognized by the required authorities
			(including authorities in the country where the speech community lives).
			This is to ensure that the whole process is made in a legal and transparent
			way.</li>
			<li>All parties must respect the national laws and the rules of the authorized
			organizations in the different countries.</li>
			<li>All parties will support the general frameworks as defined by the UN,
			UNESCO and WIPO where they are applicable.</li>
			<li>The consultants and communities will be informed openly and seriously about
			the goals of the DOBES program and about the possibilities of misuse.</li>
			<li>In general fieldworkers will document the agreed mutual understanding about
			the nature of the research and the formal consent achieved with the consultants
			by means of a signed document<sup>1</sup>.</li>
			<li>The parties will support efforts for revitalizing the languages within the limits
			of their possibilities.</li>
			<li>Fieldworkers should operate in such a way as to ensure future fieldwork and
			the reputation of their field.</li>
			<li>The parties understand their participation as part of the great challenge to
			preserve cultural heritage for future generations. This includes the obligation
			to make material as accessible for interested non-commercial users as possible.</li>
			<li>The parties will record and archive the data according to professional
			standards, but taking in consideration the limitations of the field work.</li>
			<li>The archivist will take appropriate steps to ensure long lifetime of the data.
			<li>The users of DOBES data will respect the intention of the recordings and
			acknowledge the work that the archivist and especially the collectors have
			invested. In general this is to be documented by making references in
			publications and by mentioning the names of the consultants if this is wanted.</li>
			<li>The users will give copies of all added data that will enrich the corpus to the
			archive and make it available to other interested and serious users maximally
			within three years after the analysis work has been started.</li>
			<li>A transfer of DOBES data to third persons or organizations is generally
			forbidden.</li>
